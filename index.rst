is a carefully crafted Android framework that includes:

* *DI* - injection of Views, Fragments, Services, etc.
* *ORM* - efficient persistence utilizing Cursors & fluent API.
* *EventBus* for posting event notifications.
* Simple *JSON* (de)serialization capable of handling nested objects.
* Improved *AsyncTask* & *IntentService* with Exceptions & result reporting support.
* *L*\ogger that figures out tag itself & logs any object.
* *RESTClient* for GETting, PUTting, POSTing, DELETing & InputStream-getting,
  also speaks JSON.
* *ImageFetcher* to asynchronously attach images to ImageViews, with caching,
  cross-fade & transformation support.
* Numerous *Utils*.
* *Fragments* support: native on 3.0+ and either
  pure `SupportLibrary <http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/support-library.html>`_
  or `ActionBarSherlock <https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock>`_-backed on 2.2+.

All these features come in an under 300kB jar which means â†’0 overengineering.
